## CONCLUTION

The detailed analysis of the pizza sales dataset using Power BI has provided significant insights into the busiest times, sales performance, and the best and worst-selling products. Here are the key findings and their implications for the business:

Busiest Day and Time:
Day:
Orders Are Highest On Weekends, Especially Friday and Saturday Evenings: This insight suggests that the business experiences peak order volumes during weekends, particularly in the evenings. This pattern likely reflects customers' dining habits, where they prefer to order pizzas as a treat during the weekend.
Implication: The business should ensure adequate staffing, inventory, and delivery resources during these peak times to meet the higher demand and maintain service quality.

Monthly:
Maximum Orders Are Placed in July and January: These months show a significant spike in orders, possibly due to holidays and seasonal promotions.
Implication: Seasonal marketing campaigns and promotions can be strategically planned for these months to capitalize on the increased customer demand.

Sales Performance:
Category:
Classic Category Contributes To Maximum Sales and Total Orders: The Classic pizza category is the most popular among customers, generating the highest sales and order volumes.
Implication: Focusing on maintaining and expanding the Classic pizza offerings, including introducing new variants or limited-time specials within this category, can further boost sales.

Size:
Large Size Pizza Contributes To Maximum Sales: Large pizzas are the top choice for customers, driving the most significant portion of sales.
Implication: Promotions that encourage customers to upgrade to large sizes, such as value deals or combo offers, can enhance sales.

Best Sellers:
Revenue:
The Thai Chicken Pizza Contributes To Maximum Revenue: This pizza variant generates the highest revenue, indicating strong customer preference and possibly a higher price point.
Implication: The Thai Chicken Pizza should be prominently featured in marketing materials, and its success could inspire the development of similar high-revenue items.

Total Orders and Quantity:
The Classic Deluxe Pizza Contributes To Maximum Total Orders and Quantity: This pizza variant is ordered most frequently and in the largest quantities, demonstrating broad customer appeal.
Implication: Ensuring consistent quality and availability of the Classic Deluxe Pizza is crucial, and it may be beneficial to create promotions that feature this popular item.

Worst Sellers:
Revenue, Total Orders, and Quantity:
The Brie Carre Pizza Contributes To Minimum Revenue, Total Orders, and Quantity: This pizza variant performs poorly across all sales metrics.
Implication: A review of the Brie Carre Pizza is necessary to determine whether it can be improved through recipe adjustments or marketing efforts. If not, it may be more cost-effective to remove it from the menu and replace it with a more popular option.
